As simple as it sounds, taking deep breaths throughout the day can reduce stress and blood pressure, increase oxygen flow throughout your body and have lasting positive effects on wellbeing.

Deep breathing is at the core of one of the oldest and most-proven practices of wellbeing - meditation. Meditation practitioners and yogis have incorporated this technique into their practices for millennia. Buddha was pretty calm right? The secret (don't tell) is all in breathing.

## Take three deep breaths

Simply take three deep breaths, fully filling up your lungs and slowly breathing out.

Do your best to focus on your breath and nothing else.

## Pointers for future practice

- Practice deep breathing whenever you feel a little anxious or want to become more present to the moment.
- Make sure to breathe in through your nose, if you can.
- Draw your breath deep into your belly, letting it push out as you do (rather than raising your shoulders and puffing out your chest).
- Try to exhale fully, pushing out every last bit of air.
- Imagine your in-breath as sweet, pure relaxation and your out-breath as tension and stress flowing out of your body.
- If your mind wanders, don't worry; simply bring your attention back to your breath.

Regularly doing breath work can help you feel more awake and energized!
