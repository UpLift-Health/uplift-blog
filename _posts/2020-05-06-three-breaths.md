As simple as it sounds, taking deep breaths throughout the day can reduce stress and blood pressure, increase oxygen flow throughout your body and have lasting positive effects on wellbeing.

Deep breathing is at the core of one of the oldest and most-proven practices of wellbeing - meditation. Meditation practitioners and yogis have incorporated this technique into their practices for millennia. Buddha was pretty calm right? The secret (don't tell) is all in breathing.

## Take three deep breaths

Simply take three deep breaths, fully filling up your lungs and slowly breathing out.

Do your best to focus on your breath and nothing else.
