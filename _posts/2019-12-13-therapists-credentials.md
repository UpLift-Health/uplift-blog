There are so many therapist qualifications and credentials that it can be dizzying.

A therapist's credentials are meant to communicate two main things:
- Their education
- The licenses they hold

To practice, therapists first complete the required education, and then they must be licensed by the state they wish to practice in.

We'll break down the qualifications by category.

## Psychologists with a Master's Degree
_MSC, MAPC, MMFT, LGPC, LCPC_

A psychologist must have a master's degree to practice therapy.

- MSC: Master of Science in Counseling
- MAPC: Master of Arts in Professional Counseling
- MMFT: Master of Marriage and Family Therapy
- LGPC: Licensed Graduate Professional Counselor
- LCPC: Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor

## Psychologists with a Doctorate Degree
_PhD, PsyD, DMFT, EdD_

Psychologists typically get a doctorate because they have specific research interests they wish to pursue.

- PhD: Doctor of Philosophy
- PsyD: Doctor of Psychology
- DMFT: Doctor of Marriage and Family Therapy
- EdD: Doctor of Education

## Psychiatrists
_MD_

Psychiatrists are the only mental health professionals who can prescribe medication, and often, though not always, focus on medication management rather than therapy.

They often work with other mental health professionals who provide therapy. They must complete medical school to be licensed.

- MD: Doctor of Medicine

## Social Workers
_MSW, LCSW, LCSW-C, LGSW, LISW, LMSW, LSW_

Social workers make up the largest group of mental health services providers. A master's in clinical social work is required to be licensed.

- LMFT: Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist


## Pastoral Counselors

- CCPT: Certified Clinical Pastoral Counselor
- CpastC: Certified Pastoral Counselor.

## Summary
Any of the professionals listed above have enough training to provide good quality therapy. Your compatibility with them and their areas of specialty are probably more important than the differences between their certifications.

It is important to know whether the therapist you're seeing has extensive education, or just took a 6-month course online. If a therapist you're interested in doesn't have _any_ of the above credentials, ask them why, and what they do have.
