There's no shame in asking for help, and many, many people will need it at one time or another. Don't hesitate to reach out. We all have to get through this together. 

## Financial or food assistance
- In the US, call 211 or visit [211.org](http://211.org/) to find food assistance, as well as other forms of aid.
- Consider finding your local [United Way](https://www.unitedway.org/find-your-united-way), which may offer financial assistance.
- Your town website may also offer resources.
- Learn about the [Stimulus Payments from the US Federal Government](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus-tax-relief-and-economic-impact-payments)
- Contact your utility companies and lenders to request payment arrangements and other options.
- Check with your [state government](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/Find-Unemployment-Benefits.aspx?newsearch=true) for unemployment benefits.

## Check for a Mutual Aid network in your community
A Mutual Aid group tracks volunteers in a local area willing to run errands or help others in need, and connects them with people who need support.

- Check this [Mutual Aid resource](https://mutualaiddisasterrelief.org/collective-care/) or [this one](https://www.pandemicoflove.com/) to see if a network is already established in your area.
- There may also be Facebook groups in your area where people are offering help.

## Peer support websites
- [NAMI Discussion Groups](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Air-App) These discussion boards are maintained by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. They're designed to provide users a safe space to express themselves and their challenges, and receive support from other users.
- [Elevatr](http://www.elevatr.com) This is a smartphone app designed to create a safe space to express issues and challenges relating to mental health, for both those struggling with mental health challenges and those supporting them in their struggles.
- [Depression and Bi-polar Support Alliance Groups](https://www.dbsalliance.org/support/chapters-and-support-groups/online-support-groups/). Facilitated groups to share experiences, discuss coping skills, and offer each other hope.
