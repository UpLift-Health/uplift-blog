			What's a Life Coach?

				Therapy is very different than life coaching, and while life coaching may be very useful, the two should not be confused, nor should a life coach be used as a substitute for a therapist.

				Life coaching is focused on setting goals, designing strategies to accomplish them, and keeping accountable to these goals. It focuses on maximizing individual potential and creating specific, actionable outcomes in both personal and professional life.

				Therapy tends to focus on healing pain, mental illness, or conflict within an individual or in a relationship. Most coaches are not qualified to deal with issues related to depression, trauma or grief. These require extensive training in mental health, which most coaches do not possess.

				There is no license requirement to become a life coach; anyone may call themselves one. Because of this, some people calling themselves life coaches have little to no formal training. This does not mean they can't help people reach their goals; but it does mean that there's no guarantee they've had any significant study or practice in the field.

				The field of coaching is working towards standards. Some Universities now offer coach training programs. The International Coaching Federation is working towards a standard minimum training for coaches, as well. However, it should be noted that, as yet, this proposed standard requires 10 hours of supervised practice. In contrast, a psychologist in the State of New York must have 3,500 hours of supervised practice to be licensed. This difference reflects that therapy is a medical discipline, whereas coaching is not.
