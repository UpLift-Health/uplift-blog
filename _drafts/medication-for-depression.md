Medication is certainly one option for some people with depression, particularly if it’s severe. There are many kinds of medications approved for use in treating depression, and there’s a fair amount of evidence suggesting that they work, especially in combination with therapy.

Each drug works slightly differently, and not all drugs will work for you.

## How Antidepressants Work
Your brain contains neurons, which carry messages between the brain and other parts of your body.

Your brain contains several billion neurons, which send chemical messages back and forth to each other about your movements, emotions, temperature and more.

Neurotransmitters, like serotonin and norepinephrine, are the chemicals that help send these messages. Low levels of these two are commonly associated with sad feelings and depression.

Many antidepressants are thought to work by influencing the neurotransmitters in your brain, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine. By keeping more of these neurotransmitters in the space between your neurons (the "synapse"), communication is thought to improve between neurons, and mood is better regulated.

Though extensive research is ongoing, the exact mechanisms of how antidepressants work are not yet fully understood.

## Are antidepressants effective?
Antidepressants have been shown to be effective for many people, about equally effective as psychotherapy (like [CBT](https://blog.uplift.app/what-is-cbt), though for some people one or the other may be more effective. They may help relieve certain depressive symptoms faster than therapy, particularly in severe depression, though the effects may not generally be as long-lasting as the effects of psychotherapy.

## What are the common types of antidepressants?
There are many types of antidepressants. The most common type is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs. Examples of this type are Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Celexa.

Other antidepressants include Wellbutrin, Effexor, and Cymbalta, which also affect neurotransmitters, though in slightly different ways.

Some people do respond to older classes of antidepressants like tetracyclics, tricyclics, MAOIs, and others, but they typically have more side effects.


## What should I know if I'm considering antidepressant medications?

- **You should take them as prescribed** Don't skip doses or stop entirely without consulting your physician or psychiatrist. Even if your antidepressant is not working the way you would like, it can be even worse to change your dosage yourself or stop altogether.
- **Antidepressants can have side effects**. Common side effects can include increased anxiety, indigestion, loss of appetite, dizziness, headaches, and loss of sex drive. Most side effects go away in a few weeks and are simply the result of your body and brain adjusting to a new medication. Other side effects, however, can persist. You should consult your physician about the specific side effects of whichever antidepressant you are being considered for.
- **If you're under 25, there's an increased risk of suicidal thoughts while starting antidepressants.** Additionally, anyone with a history of or family history of bipolar disorder should use caution when starting antidepressants as they can increase the likelihood of a manic episode.

Despite these side effects, many people successfully manage and treat their depression with antidepressants.

## How does medication compare to psychotherapy?
Research suggests that on average, medication does no better or worse than psychotherapy, and some people see better results when they combine psychological and pharmacological treatment.

It should not be surprising that when people stop taking medication, their improvements often subside, but it may surprise you that after a course of short-term psychotherapy, especially if it’s evidence-based like [CBT](https://blog.uplift.app/what-is-cbt), people often experience long-lasting positive effects even years after they stop psychotherapy.

This is one reason explore [different therapy options](https://blog.uplift.app/types-of-therapy), even if you start medication. Therapy can provide skills and strategies to help you combat depression in the long run so that you do not need to take antidepressants forever.
