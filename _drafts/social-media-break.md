For many, checking social media too frequently can be a downer. Research has linked social media use with [depression and loneliness](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751) as well as [lower overall well-being](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/185/3/203/2915143).

Constantly keeping up with the news may have similar mental health effects. [A survey in 2017](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/11/lowest-point) found that 56% of adults say following the news causes them stress.

So how do you unplug? Here are 10 tips.

**1. Pay attention to how you feel after using social media or reading news.**
Do these activities tend to bring you down? It's good to be aware of. How does your overall mood feel if you take a break for a while?

**2. Adjust notifications and settings.**
Turn off any notifications about new posts from friends, pages, or groups that post content that brings you down.

**3. Use website-blocking apps.**
[Freedom|https://freedom.to/] or [BlockSite|https://blocksite.co/] can help you to block news or social media except for certain hours of the day. For example, you could limit these sites and apps to just one hour a day around lunch or dinner. First thing in the morning and just before bed are good times to use a blocker.

**4. Use social media to connect not consume.**
Send messages, video call, or post positive content, rather than passively scroll through the newsfeed.

**5. Use post-it note reminders to limit time**
You can set these on your computer or phone as a visual reminder. You could also write down activities that would be better to do in that moment, like a satisfying stretch or a few deep breaths to help you shift your focus.

**6. Be mindful of envy and upward comparisons.**
Social media can paint a rosier-than-reality picture of others and lead to envy, but [mindful comparisons](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201711/the-comparison-trap) can help you connect and increase gratitude.

**7. Be mindful of what YOU share**
Sharing inaccurate pieces of news can inadvertently spread fear. Focus on sharing reputable news sources or just things that are positive and uplifting.

**8. Consider a social media break**
You can de-activate your account without deleting it. Some people even make a practice of de-activating their accounts for the weekend.

**9. Ask a trustworthy friend to relay important news**
If you'd rather avoid the news altogether, this can be helpful strategy.

**10. Use only reliable sources to access news**
Every news source carries at least some risk of bias and misreported facts. For staying up to date on information related to COVID-19, use the [CDC|https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html], the [World Health Organization|https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019], and your local government authorities.
