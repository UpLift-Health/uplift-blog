Did you hear that? Your brain is busy at work! As the page opened it likely evaluated the image and header, maybe jumped into a moment from earlier in the day. Your brain constantly evaluates, reflects, judges.

Sometimes brains get cranky. They start thinking things that are untrue, exaggerated, or very unhelpful. Things like, "I chew SO loudly" or "I *always* forget to put on pants!" (*sometimes* I remember, give me some credit brain!).

When brains get going, they can fall into many common thinking traps, things like:
- **Catastrophizing**: Imagining the worst-case scenario ("If the brakes go on this train I wonder if I could pry the door open and jump")
- **Should statements**: Thinking you "should" or "shouldn't" "do something ("I should seriously stop eating this entire tub of ice cream")
- **Overgeneralizing**: Using "always" or "never" statements ("I always have an awkwardly goofy expression in photos")
- **Negative filter**: Focusing on the bad aspects of something while ignoring what's good. ("I managed to do a gazillion loads of laundry and missed this one dirty sock - UGH!")

Thinking errors like these are usually untrue and unhelpful.

Taking time to examine whether a thought is fact or fiction, and coming up with a better alternative, can build resilience.

## Practice challenging thinking errors
1. What's an untrue or unhelpful thought you've had recently?

Got it? Okay. Now...

2. What's an alternative thought you could have that's more reasonable or helpful?

Now...

3. What evidence do you have that supports the thought error? How about the alternative thought?

Good.

4. If you're still plagued by the original thought error, taking steps to gather evidence can help (e.g. keeping a log of your successes if you believe you frequently fail).

5. You can also do some formal problem solving to resolve any aspects of your thought error that may have some truth ([UpLift](https://www.uplift.app/) has a free tool for this).

Throughout your day, practice pausing to listen in on your thoughts. Notice how they affect your mood, check them for accuracy, and recalibrate them as needed to be more helpful and hopeful.
