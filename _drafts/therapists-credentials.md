There are so many different qualifications and credentials that a therapist can have that it can be dizzying.

A therapist's credentials are meant to communicate two main things, their education and the licenses they hold. To practice, therapists are first required to complete the required education, and then must be licensed by the state they wish to practice in.

We'll break down the qualifications by category.

Some general rules: Any credential beginning with an L indicates that it is a license from a state to practice some type of therapy. Social workers will always have an "SW" in their credential.

## Psychologists with a Master's Degree
_MA, MS, LGPC, LCPC_
A psychologist must have a master's degree to practice therapy.

## Psychologists with a Doctorate Degree
_PhD, PsyD, EdD_
Psychologists typically get doctorate because they have specific research interests they wish to pursue.

## Psychiatrists
_MD_
Psychiatrists are the only mental health professionals who can prescribe medication, and often, though not always, focus on medication management rather than therapy. They often work with other mental health professionals who provide therapy. They must complete medical school to be licensed..

## Social Workers
_MSW, LGSW, LCSW, LMSW, LCSW-C, LISW, LSW_
A master's in clinical social work is required to be licensed.

## Marriage and Family Therapists
_MA, MFT, LMFT, LCMFT_
A master's in marriage and family therapy is required to be licensed.

## Pastoral Counselors
_MA, CCPT, CpastC, NCPC, NCCA_
Note: A pastoral counselor is different than a pastor who may sometimes give informal spiritual counseling. A pastoral counselor has completed a master's program in Pastoral Counseling or Pastoral Therapy.

Any of the professionals listed above have enough training to provide good quality therapy. Your compatibility with them and their areas of specialty are probably more important than the differences between their certifications.

It is important to know whether the therapist you're seeing has the extensive education, or just took a 6-month course online. If a therapist you're interested in doesn't have _any_ of the above credentials, ask them why, and what they do have.
