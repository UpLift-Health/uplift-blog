During times of uncertainty such as COVID-19, accepting the things you cannot change can help you to feel more control.

## Accepting what you CAN control
While there's a lot that's out of our control during the time of coronavirus, it can help to focus on what you *can* control.

- Your daily routine
- Mastering new tasks, like working from home
- Keeping a safe distance
- Washing your hands
- Finding small ways to help or spread hope

A few slow, deep breaths can help as you shift your focus.

## Accepting anxiety
Acknowledging things like "I feel scared right now" can also be powerful. See if you can shift your thoughts to be more accepting:

- "I shouldn't feel scared" -> "I feel scared right now and that's okay."
- "I shouldn't feel happy at a time like this" -> "I feel happy and positive feelings can help us get through this"
- "I should be doing something more productive" -> "It's okay that I'm not giving everything 100% of my effort right now"
- "I shouldn't feel so X" -> "I'm going to give myself permission to feel X for a little while right now"

## Write it out
If you have a minute now, you could pull out a piece of paper and a pen and write down reminders of what's in your control and words of acceptance for what you're going through and how you're feeling. Try to think of things you might say to a dear friend to show support.

As you go about your day, try to pause every now and then to practice acceptance.
