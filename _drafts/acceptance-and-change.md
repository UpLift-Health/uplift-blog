During times of uncertainty, accepting the things you cannot change can help you to feel more control.

## Accepting what you can't and CAN control
While there's a lot that's out of our control, such as how far the virus may spread or what other people do, it can help to focus on what you /can/ control.
*list
	Washing your hands
	Keeping a safe distance
	Your daily routine
	Mastering new tasks, like working from home
	Finding small ways to help or spread hope

## Accepting anxiety
Acknowledging things like "I feel scared right now" can also be powerful. See if you can shift your thoughts to be more accepting:
*list
	"I shouldn't feel scared" -> "I feel scared right now and that's okay."
	"I shouldn't feel happy at a time like this" -> "I feel happy and positive feelings can help us get through this"
	"I should be doing something more productive" -> "It's okay that I'm not giving everything 100% of my effort right now"
	"I shouldn't feel so X" -> "I'm going to give myself permission to feel X for a little while right now"

*question: Write down any ways you'd like to be accepting of what you can control and what you're going through.

You may find it helpful to write this down somewhere. Throughout your day, try to remember to pause every now and then to practice acceptance.
